# Kern-Bot

This bot is being shut down forever on the 22 of May 2020, because:
- discord's new bot policies require me to send in photo identification with no information on what they will do with it or how they will store it
- The main functionality of this bot has never worked.
- and I have no interest in working on this bot anymore.
